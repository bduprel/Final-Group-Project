# Final-Group-Project
My group consisted of Carissa, Samantha, Sara, and myself. Carissa took the role of handling SQL, Sara was over our tableau dashboard and setting up the get hub, Samantha was over data cleaning and pre-processing, and I created the machine learning model.

## Self Assessment
As for myself and the machine learning model. I had the most interest in this section of the project, but probably also the topic we all had the least exposure with. It was tricky to learn from YouTube videos and Googling articles. But through that and with help from Samantha, I feel I was able to complete my task and contribute to the success of the project. 

## Team Assessment
I feel all team members did what was asked of them and carried their weight. I greatly enjoyed working with all three and would happily do so again. They are all very intelligent and hardworking individuals. We primary communicated via Zoom during class hours and via Slack when outside of those hours. Class was far more efficient however. 

## Project Summary
We chose to see if there was a way to measure price change of houses in New York due to a change in population. The idea being that prices should have decreased during covid due to people leaving big cities, and increased in smaller cities for people moving there. This was done with a linear regression model and looked at factors to assess the house value as well as the changes in populations from 2019 to 2021 for select cities.
